Exodus 
=======

Exodus is a WordPress theme that departs from 'normal' Web Design trends, with flashy, smooth and slick elements.
Utilising Brutalist web design and CSS Grid. Exodus returns the Web to a simpler time.

Some of the core theme code is borrowed from the awesome _s theme found at http://underscores.me/


Still in early stages

Installation
